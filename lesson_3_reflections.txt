When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    If I'm working with some other people together on the same project, resp. files.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    - It's better if I have some changes only locally and commit them to remote repository for other people only in case all tests are successful and I'm pretty sure that no files with errors are sent to other people.
    - I also want to pull only if one featuer or bugfix is completed or if I can't work any longer on it.
    
    
Commands:
git remote | Show all remote locations for the repository
git remote add origin url | Add a new remote location for the repository. Origin is the default name to use when you create only one remote location. Url should be the https url to the github repository.
git remove -v | Outputs the remote locations with verbose information (fetch and push urls)
git push origin master | Push the master branch to the remote location origin.
git pull origin master | Get the master branch from the remote location origin.
git pull origin master | = Git fetch origin + git merge master origin/master
git fetch origin | Get the changes from the remote location into the (hidden?) origin/master branch
